# Calorie Counter Project

Welcome to my Calorie Counter project! This was the second challenge I completed using freeCodeCamp's amazing curriculum! In this calorie counter project, I delved into the world of user input validation, mathematical calculations, and dynamic interface updates. Through this hands-on practice, I gained valuable skills that are crucial for building interactive web applications.

## What I Learned

- **Regular Expressions:** I learned the basics of regular expressions, a powerful tool for pattern matching and validation.
- **Template Literals:** I explored template literals, a convenient way to create strings with dynamic content.
- **addEventListener() Method:** I understood how to use the `addEventListener()` method to listen for user input and trigger appropriate actions.
- **Basic JavaScript Concepts:** I reinforced my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts while building a practical application.

## Repository Contents

- **index.html:** The main HTML file for my Calorie Counter application.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file containing styles for the user interface of the calorie counter.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic and functionality of the calorie counter application.
